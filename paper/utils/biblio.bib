The interpretation of independence and the way it is utilized, however, varies across these methods. Our aim in this paper is to propose a group theoretic framework for ICM to unify and generalize these approaches. In our setting, the cause-mechanism relationship is assessed by perturbing it with random group transformations. We show that the group theoretic view encompasses previous ICM approaches and provides a very general tool to study the structure of data generating mechanisms with direct applications to machine learning.}

Unlike methods of analysis of {fMRI} data that test the time course of each voxel against a hypothesized waveform, data-driven methods, such as independent component analysis and clustering, attempt to find common features within the data. This exploratory approach can be revealing when the brain activation is difficult to predict beforehand, such as with complex stimuli and internal shifts of activation that are not time-locked to an easily specified sensory or motor event. These methods can be further improved by incorporating prior knowledge regarding the temporal and spatial extent of brain activation.},

	abstract     = {In this paper we describe a method for functional connectivity analysis of fMRI data between given brain regions-of-interest (ROIs). The method relies on nonnegativity constrained- and spatially regularized multiset canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and assigns weights to the fMRI signals of the ROIs so that their representative signals become simultaneously maximally correlated. The different pairwise correlations between the representative signals of the ROIs are combined using the maxvar approach for multiset CCA, which has been shown to be equivalent to the generalized eigenvector formulation of CCA. The eigenvector in the maxvar approach gives an indication of the relative importance of each ROI in obtaining a maximal overall correlation, and hence, can be interpreted as a functional connectivity pattern of the ROIs. The successive canonical correlations define subsequent functional connectivity patterns, in decreasing order of importance. We apply our method on synthetic data and real fMRI data and show its advantages compared to unconstrained CCA and to PCA. Furthermore, since the representative signals for the ROIs are optimized for maximal correlation they are also ideally suited for further effective connectivity analyses, to assess the information flows between the ROIs in the brain.}

The Cam-CAN Stage 2 repository contains multi-modal (MRI, MEG, and cognitive-behavioural) data from a large (approximately N=700), cross-sectional adult lifespan (18–87years old) population-based sample. The study is designed to characterise age-related changes in cognition and brain structure and function, and to uncover the neurocognitive mechanisms that support healthy cognitive ageing. The database contains raw and preprocessed structural MRI, functional MRI (active tasks and resting state), and MEG data (active tasks and resting state), as well as derived scores from cognitive behavioural experiments spanning five broad domains (attention, emotion, action, language, and memory), and demographic and neuropsychological data. The dataset thus provides a depth of neurocognitive phenotyping that is currently unparalleled, enabling integrative analyses of age-related changes in brain structure, brain function, and cognition, and providing a testbed for novel analyses of multi-modal neuroimaging data.}

In this study, participants viewed a fifty-minute audio-visual movie, then verbally described the events while undergoing functional MRI. These descriptions were completely unguided and highly detailed, lasting for up to forty minutes. As each person spoke, event-specific spatial patterns were reinstated (movie-vs.-recall correlation) in default network, medial temporal, and high-level visual areas; moreover, individual event patterns were highly discriminable and similar between people during recollection (recall-vs.-recall similarity), suggesting the existence of spatially organized memory representations. In posterior medial cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and angular gyrus, activity patterns during recall were more similar between people than to patterns elicited by the movie, indicating systematic reshaping of percept into memory across individuals. These results reveal striking similarity in how neural activity underlying real-life memories is organized and transformed in the brains of different people as they speak spontaneously about past events.},
